                <h3>Recipe Cuisine</h3>
                <p> Vegetarian cuisine is based on food that meets vegetarian standards by not including meat and animal
                    tissue products.Lacto-ovo vegetarianism (the most common type of vegetarianism in the Western world)
                    includes eggs and dairy products</p>

                <h3>Recipe Lacto</h3>
                <p> Lacto vegetarianism includes dairy products but not eggs, and ovo vegetarianism encompasses eggs but
                    not dairy products.The strictest form of vegetarianism is veganism, which excludes all animal
                    products, including dairy, honey, and some refined sugars.

                <h3>Recipe Ovo</h3>
                <p>Ovo vegetarianism is a type of vegetarianism which allows for the consumption of eggs but
                    not dairy products, in contrast with lacto vegetarianism. Those who practice ovo vegetarianism are
                    called ovo-vegetarians. "Ovo" comes from the Latin word for egg.</p>
